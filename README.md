# Gffparser #
GFFParser is a Python utility for parsing NCBI formatted GFF3 files into a format understandable by SDDetector. It is built on Python 3.10.

## To run py file simply run following command : 
python SDDGFFParser.py <input_file_path> <chromosome_id>

To run the Python script, simply execute the following command:
bash
python SDDGFFParser.py <input_file_path> <chromosome_id>

### input_file_path: This is the path to the GFF3 file that you want to parse.
### chromosome_id: You can specify the chromosome ID, e.g., "chr1," "chr2," "chr3," or any other string that SDDetector prefers.

### This utility is designed to support SDDetector's GFF files, and it currently works with NCBI GFF files. However, it can be further improved to handle other datasets.
